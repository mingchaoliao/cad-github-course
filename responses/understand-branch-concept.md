## Step 4: Understand Git Branching

[Read this article](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Branching-Branches-in-a-Nutshell) to understand git branching concept. To complete this step:

1. create a new branch out of the existing branch `task`. The new branch should have a name in format `<jira_story_id>-learn-git-branching`. The `<jira_story_id>` is the JIRA story ID you put in the comment in `Step 1`. 
2. create an empty file (name: `result.txt`).
3. Replace the content in the file `greeting.txt` with a string `Hello World!`.
4. Commit and push the changes to the new branch.
